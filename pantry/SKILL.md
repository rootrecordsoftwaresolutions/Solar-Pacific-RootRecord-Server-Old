  Household food stock: what is on the shelf, add/use counts, and which recipes

  what we can cook from stock. Not the nutrition database.

# pantry

Shelf counts from `store/stock.json`. If it is not in that file, we do
not have it on file.

```bash
python3 ~/.ollama/skills/pantry/scripts/pantry.py
python3 ~/.ollama/skills/pantry/scripts/pantry.py add onion 2 ea
python3 ~/.ollama/skills/pantry/scripts/pantry.py use onion 1
python3 ~/.ollama/skills/pantry/scripts/pantry.py set bananas 6 ea
```

Hidden council tags (not spoken): `<<<PANTRY add onion | 2 | ea>>>`
`<<<PANTRY use onion | 1>>>`.

## Rules

1. Log what they say they bought, used, or still have. Qty can be `some` if they
   did not count.
2. After a cook, offer to `use` the ingredients. Do not auto-drain unless they
   said it was eaten or used up.
3. `cooking` `from-pantry` reads this store. `nutrition` does not change counts.
4. Empty pantry is a valid state. Say so.
