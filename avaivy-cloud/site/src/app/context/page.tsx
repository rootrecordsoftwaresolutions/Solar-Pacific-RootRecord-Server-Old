        <h2>Runtime</h2>
        <p>
          Ava Ivy operates as infrastructure and a public runtime surface inside the Root
          Record ecosystem. Current work is centered on the Ava host and its connected
          services, with public surfaces separated from private implementation details.

          <li>Home tree: <code>/home/ava-core/ava</code></li>
          <li>Public context changes as active operations change.</li>
          <li>Production edits are built and validated before deployment.</li>
          <li>RootMC has its own operational boundary and context surface.</li>

        <h2>Working boundaries</h2>
        <p>
          Ava is not treated as a single monolithic process. Host operations, web surfaces,
          scheduled work, integrations, and higher-cost AI workloads can be separated and
          measured independently.
        </p>
        <p>
          Always-on services stay small, while heavier compute can remain asleep or be
          requested only when needed.
